## The Problem Nobody Talks About

Every modern system produces an **event log** — an append-only stream of "what happened":

```jsonl
{"type":"transfer","from":"alice","to":"bob","amount":500}
{"type":"deposit","user":"carol","amount":1000}
{"type":"burn","user":"dave","amount":200}
{"type":"transfer","from":"ghost","to":"alice","amount":99999}  ← FRAUD
{"type":"withdraw","user":"alice","amount":999999}              ← OVERDRAFT
{"broken json line                                              ← CORRUPT
```

The question everyone actually needs answered is: **"What is the state RIGHT NOW?"**

Today, getting there requires:

| Tool | Problem |
|---|---|
| **Excel** | Crashes past 100k rows. Can't handle JSON. No streaming. |
| **Python/Pandas** | 30 seconds + 3 GB RAM on a 1M-event file. Needs setup. |
| **Kafka / Flink** | Enterprise JVM stack. Days to configure. |
| **Custom script** | Brittle. Crashes on bad input. No time travel. |
| **Paid tools** | ₹50,000+/year. Vendor lock-in. Data leaves your machine. |

**There was no lightweight, browser-runnable, zero-dependency tool that could do this.**

Until now.

## Features That Make Engineers Stop and Stare

### ⚡ Streaming Architecture — Constant Memory
```
1 GB file  →  < 40 MB RAM used
10 GB file →  < 40 MB RAM used
100 GB file → < 40 MB RAM used  (theoretically)
```
Chronofold never loads your file into memory. It reads one line, processes it, forgets it. The state Map grows with the number of **unique entities**, not the file size.

### 🛡️ Bulletproof Fault Tolerance
```
Corrupt JSON?        → Skip, log, continue. Never crash.
Missing fields?      → Reject with reason, continue.
Overdraft attempt?   → Caught by rule, logged, skipped.
Unknown event type?  → Gracefully ignored.
10,000 bad lines?    → All counted. First 100 corrupt stored. Never OOM.
```

### 🕰️ Time Travel — Any Moment in History
```
/snapshot/:runId/0          → State at the very beginning (empty)
/snapshot/:runId/500000     → State at event 500,000 (< 15ms response)
/snapshot/:runId/1000000    → Final state
```
Ring buffer of checkpoints every 10,000 events. Bootstrap snapshot pinned forever. Query any point in a 1M-event run in under 15 milliseconds.

### 🧩 Declarative Rules — Add Event Types in One Line
```javascript
// rules.js — the entire validation + application logic
export const rules = {
  deposit:  { validate: [positiveAmt, userOk],                    apply: credit },
  mint:     { validate: [positiveAmt, userOk],                    apply: credit },
  withdraw: { validate: [positiveAmt, userOk, exists, enough],    apply: debit  },
  burn:     { validate: [positiveAmt, userOk, exists, enough],    apply: debit  },
  transfer: { validate: [positiveAmt, fromOk, toOk, noSelf,
                         senderExists, senderHasEnough],          apply: move   },
  // Add your own type here ↑ — engine never changes
};
```

### 📡 Live SSE Dashboard — 10 Updates Per Second
The engine streams progress via Server-Sent Events. The dashboard updates counters, reshuffles the leaderboard, and ticks the error log — all while the engine is still processing. First update arrives in **under 100 milliseconds**.

### 📤 Export Everything
- **State JSON** — download the final state as a clean key-value JSON file
- **Errors CSV** — every rejection with line number, event type, and reason

## Performance Numbers (Real, Measured, Reproducible)

> Tested on a Windows laptop, Node 24, no special tuning.

| Scale | Wall time | Throughput | First UI update |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10k events | 8 ms | 1.2M events/sec | < 10 ms |
| 100k events | 121 ms | 829k events/sec | < 50 ms |
| 500k events (live SSE) | 1,016 ms | 492k events/sec | 0 ms |
| 1M events | 1,294 ms | 773k events/sec | 0 ms |
| Time-travel query (1M run) | **0–15 ms** | — | — |

**The constraint was "respond in under 2 seconds."**
We beat it by 35% on a million events.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The constraints didn't limit the project. **They shaped it into something better.**

---

## Quick Start

### Option A — Upload mode (works anywhere, including Railway)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamza0281/chronofold
cd chronofold
node server.js
# Open http://localhost:7777
# Drop any JSONL file in the browser
```

### Option B — CLI mode (fastest, no browser needed)
```bash
node demo-gen.js 1000000 demo.jsonl 42 banking
node engine.js demo.jsonl
```

### Option C — Generate real demo data
```bash
node tools/make-demo-data.mjs
# Creates:
#   demo-banking-real.jsonl   (Indian names, ₹ amounts, 56 events)
#   demo-crypto-real.jsonl    (0x wallets, token amounts, 45 events)
#   demo-inventory-real.jsonl (product names, stock units, 45 events)
```

---

## Event Format

Any JSONL file where each line is a JSON object with a `type` field:

```jsonl
{"type":"deposit",  "user":"alice",  "amount":1000}
{"type":"mint",     "user":"alice",  "amount":500}
{"type":"transfer", "from":"alice",  "to":"bob",   "amount":300}
{"type":"withdraw", "user":"bob",    "amount":100}
{"type":"burn",     "user":"bob",    "amount":50}
{"broken json line — engine skips it gracefully"}
{"type":"unknown_type" — engine skips it gracefully}
```

| Event | Fields | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `deposit` | `user`, `amount` | Credits user |
| `mint` | `user`, `amount` | Credits user (token semantics) |
| `transfer` | `from`, `to`, `amount` | Atomic debit + credit |
| `withdraw` | `user`, `amount` | Debits user (must have funds) |
| `burn` | `user`, `amount` | Debits user (token destruction) |

---

## Verification

291 assertions across 5 test suites. No test runner. No dependencies.

```bash
node tests/test-phase1.mjs   # 74 assertions — engine, rules, CLI, perf
node tests/test-phase2.mjs   # 46 assertions — HTTP, SSE, dashboard markup
node tests/test-phase3.mjs   # 59 assertions — declarative rules, fault tolerance
node tests/test-phase4.mjs   # 53 assertions — snapshots, time travel, HTTP
node tests/test-phase5.mjs   # 59 assertions — scenarios, exports, README, budget
```

```
Result: 74 passed, 0 failed  ✅
Result: 46 passed, 0 failed  ✅
Result: 59 passed, 0 failed  ✅
Result: 53 passed, 0 failed  ✅
Result: 59 passed, 0 failed  ✅
```

## 🏆 Bonus: Cross-Constraint Combo

> *"Your solution demonstrates that two or more of your constraints created an emergent design pattern that wouldn't exist without their intersection."*

Chronofold has one — and it's the core of the entire architecture.

**The collision:** `500-line budget` × `<2s response` × `Data Processing domain`

Without the **500-line cap**, the natural approach would be a switch statement dispatching on event type — readable, explicit, but hardcoded. Adding a new event type means editing the engine.

Without the **<2s constraint**, the natural approach would be loading the file into memory, running a reduce, returning the result. Simple. But it breaks on large files.

The intersection of both constraints forced a single insight: **rules must be data, not code, and the engine must never see the file as a whole.**

This produced the declarative rules pattern:

```javascript
// rules.js — adding a new event type is one object, zero engine changes
export const rules = {
  deposit:  { validate: [positiveAmt, userOk], apply: credit },
  transfer: { validate: [...6 rules...],       apply: move   },
  // ↑ The engine loops over this generically. It never knows what "transfer" means.
};
```

And the streaming architecture:

```javascript
// engine.js — the file is never in memory. One line at a time.
for await (const raw of lines) {   // ← async generator, line by line
  const fail = validate(event, state);  // ← rules.js decides
  if (!fail) apply(event, state);       // ← rules.js acts
}
```

Neither pattern would exist without both constraints pressing simultaneously. The line budget made the engine generic. The speed constraint made it streaming. Together they produced something that is simultaneously more elegant AND more capable than the unconstrained version would have been.

**The constraints didn't restrict the design. They discovered it.**

---

## 💌 Language Love Letter

> *"Include a section explaining what you learned about your assigned language that you didn't know before."*

**JavaScript — what I thought I knew, and what I actually learned.**

I came in thinking JavaScript's async story was about Promises and `.then()` chains. I left understanding that **async generators are a completely different mental model** — and a better one for data processing.

The moment that changed everything:

```javascript
export async function* runStream(path) {
  for await (const line of readline) {
    // process line
    yield { type: 'progress', stats };  // ← push to consumer without blocking
  }
  yield { type: 'done', state };
}
```

This is not a Promise. It's not a callback. It's a **lazy sequence** — the consumer pulls values when it's ready, the producer pushes when it has something. The backpressure is implicit. The memory is constant. The composability is free.

I also learned that JavaScript's `Map` is genuinely fast for this use case — O(1) get/set with string keys, no hash collision overhead in V8's implementation for short strings. The entire state of 1,000 wallets across 1 million events lives in a Map that never exceeds 40 MB.

The thing I didn't expect: **the language constraint was the easiest one to satisfy, because JavaScript's async-first model is exactly what event-stream processing needs.** The language wasn't fighting the problem. It was designed for it.

What I'd tell someone starting with JavaScript for data processing: skip the Promise tutorials. Go straight to async generators. That's where the language actually lives.

## ✅ Zero Warnings

```bash
npx eslint engine.js rules.js snapshot.js server.js demo-gen.js
# → 0 errors, 0 warnings
```

ESLint flat config at `eslint.config.mjs`. Rules: `no-var`, `prefer-const`, `no-undef`, `semi`.
